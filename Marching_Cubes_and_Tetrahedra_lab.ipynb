    "In this project, you will implement the Marching Cubes and Marching Tetrahedra algorithms to generate isosurfaces from volumetric data.  The superquadric primitives will be employed as the volumetric data to be visualized to illustrate the differences.  Before proceeding with the project, you should read chapter 2 \"Marching Cubes and Variants\" from the book __Isosurfaces: Geometry, Toplogy, and Algorithms__ by Rephael Wenger (CRC Press / AK Peters Publishing).  The book can be downloaded for free as a .pdf from the CRC Press website when accessed through the UIUC library.\n",

    "__Marching Cubes__ is an algorithm for generating isosurfaces from volumetric data by subdividing a volume into virtual cubes and marching through the volume evaluating each cube in turn.  The results of each cube are stitched together to form a contiguous polygon mesh as the isosurface.  Marching Cubes can be easily implemented with the use of a lookup table and performs in linear time making it a practical choice for generating isosurfaces.  However the algorithm has a few weaknesses.  One weakness is data in some cubes may be ambiguous leading to uncertainty as to how the isosurface should be constructed.  Either additional computation, or conscious biased choices in the lookup table must be made to resolve ambiguities and produce a cohesive isosurface.  Reference: [Marching Cubes (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Marching Tetrahedra__ is a variation employed by many who couldn't use Marching Cubes due to patent restrictions.  Marching Tetrahedra can be viewed as an extension of Marching Cubes as it follows the same principle but dissects the cubes into tetrahedra producing more granularity which resolves all ambiguity and produces a correct isosurface every time.  However, this comes at the expense of additional computation and significantly more triangles and vertices in the resulting isosurface.  Within the Marching tetrahedra algorithm are variants decomposing the cube into 5 tetrahedra or 6 tetrahedra.  Each has their strengths and weaknesses as we'll see later.  Reference: [Marching Tetrahedra (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_tetrahedra).\n",

    "__Superquadrics__ are a class of primitives defined by variations of the sphere equation.  In addition to scientific visualization, superquadrics have been employed in computer graphics under the name of 'metaballs' or 'blobby particles' for density based modeling techniques favorable to haptic sculpting and simulating modeling with clay.  Metaballs are usually enhanced with features such as attractive and repulsive blending enabling metaballs to act as carving and shaping tools in the modeling process, and to represent liquids and other formless shapes.  When the number of metaballs becomes large, representation moves to point clouds employing blobby particles.   One example of superquadrics used as metaballs in commercial filmmaking is the main animated character in the 1997 movie [Flubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubber_(film)).  Commerical software applications using this technique include [Z-Brush (PixelLogic)](https://pixologic.com/) and [MudBox (AutoDesk)](https://www.autodesk.com/products/mudbox/overview).

    "# Part 1: Generate a polygon mesh from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project isosurfaces are represented as polygon meshes.  Polygon meshes can represent just about any surface due to it's arbitrary nature, and most algorithms can be employed without sophisticated mathematics.  However, polygon meshes are approximations of the surface they represent as all vertices are connected by linear edges. For example, it would require near infinite resolution to represent a highly curved surface as the linear edges would require many vertices to be placed close together to approximate the curvature making for an impractical choice.  Therefore, the result is always a compromise between the desired output and the available computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygon meshes can be created in PyVista using the pyvista.PolyData() class.  PolyData requires two lists:\n",
    "1. Vertex Positions\n",
    "2. Polygon connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex positions are provided as a list of XYZ position vectors described in the coordinate space of the object.  Each position vector is a 1D array of scalars of size 3.\n",

    "The polygon connectivity is provided as a list of face descriptions.  Each face description a 1D array of __N+1__ entries, where __N__ represents the number of sides in the polygon and is the first value in the face description.  The trailing values are the indices of the vertices in the vertex positions list which form the polygon and specified in the order that respects the _right hand rule_.  The last specified index will automatically be connected by an edge to the first specified index to complete the polygon.  Face descriptions must be provided as row vectors, hence the use of np.hstack() below to format the list.  Keep that in mind if using something other than numpy to form your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Right hand rule__:  If you use your right hand and curl the fingers to point in the direction that follows the order the vertices are connected, the thumb will point in the direction of the surface normal.  If defined correctly, the surface normal will point out of your screen when looking at a 2D polygon (the vertices should be connected in counter-clockwise order around the perimeter of the polygon).  If the order is incorrect, the polygon will be inverted, or in some extreme cases, throw errors.  Exact details of how this situation is handled varies by API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, construct two polygon mesh cubes, each from a vertex positions list and polygon connectivity list.  The vertex positions should be confined to the range [0...1] on the X, Y, and Z axes.  For the first polygon mesh, desribe the faces as triangles.  In the second polygon mesh, describe each face as a quadrilateral polygon."

    "# Part 3: Define the Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can visualize anything, we must define the domain in which the visualization will occur.  For this project we'll define a rectangular volume in cartesian coordinate space with arbitrary dimension, and define resolution by spacing between the grid points.  This volume will be known as a _scalar field_.  The scalar field is a 3 dimensional grid whose points contain an arbitrary scalar value of importance relative to the data we're visualizing.  The space between the points and shaped liked cubes will be referred to as _cells_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Marching Cubes and Marching Tetrahedra algorithms traverse the scalar field cell-by-cell gathering scalars from the grid points and applying them as values on the corners of the cells.  The cell is then evaluated by looking for discrepancy between vertices sharing an edge.  When a discrepancy is found, it means the isosurface intersects that edge, and we need to insert a vertex at the location of the intersection.  After the cell is evaluated, the inserted vertices are connected to form triangles of the isosurface.  The field can be traversed in any order, but we will do it in the X, Y, then Z order (with Z being the vertical axis) to correlate with the lookup tables we'll define.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated isosurface will be affected by a few factors:\n",
    "- __Cell size__: Distance between adjacent vertices along an axis in the scalar field, and uniform across all axes.\n",
    "- __Dimensions__: Size of scalar field in each axis.  Defined by 2 positions representing the min and max corners of the bounding box.\n",
    "- __IsoValue__: Scalar value at which the isosurface will be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell size affects the resolution of the isosurface.  Smaller sizes bring scalar field points closer together producing an isosurface with finer details, but also increase computation and memory requirements significantly as more points are needed to cover a field of the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions of the scalar field affect how much of the isosurface is seen.  If the isosurface extends beyond the dimensions of the scalar field, it will be truncated at the field's boundary.  This can be a useful tactic when you only want to visualize a portion of a larger data set by transforming the data (or the field) so only the area of interest appears in the scalar field.\n",

    "## Implement the Cell class\n",
    "\n",
    "The Marching Cubes and Marching Tetrahedra algorithms get their name by the fact the algorithm marches through a scalar field and evaluates each cell to produce an isosurface.  This implies we must have a cell to evaluate, which we haven't created yet.  In this section we'll implement the __Cell__ class to represent a cell in the scalar field.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell is a virtual cube surrounding an arbitrary location in the scalar field that isn't a grid point.  It has 8 vertices, and in the case of Marching Tetrahedra 6, has 19 edges.  The first 12 edges define the shape of the cube, and the last 7 edges represent the diagonals on the faces defining the arrangement of tetrahedra.  But you say, \"wait a minute - a cube only has 6 diagonals!\".  To that you would be correct.  The 7th diagonal runs from the lower-left-front vertex to the upper-right-rear vertex (opposite corners).  All the tetrahedra in the cell share this diagonal as a common edge, which makes Marching Tetrahedra 6 an easier algorithm to implement, and why we are doing it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we evaluate each cell in isolation, the resulting isosurface will be a collection of triangles casually known as a 'polygon soup'.  That is, the generated triangles will collectively form a quilt of the isosurface, but they will not share any vertices or edges to form a contiguous surface.  Polygon soups are inefficient because they require more storage space due to duplication of features.  They also present problems when manipulated as the surface tends to split easily because the triangles are not connected, and is especially poor during rendering as numerical imprecision make the polygon mesh appear to have slivers/cracks between adjacent triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cell class will be responsible for keeping track of which edges contain vertices (intersections) inserted by the Marching algorithm so the triangles from adjacent cells can be stitched together to form a continguous polygon mesh where all the edges and vertices are shared.  To do this, the components of the cell must be numbered consistently to make the algorithm work.  We'll use the following vertex and edge ordering:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Marching Tetrahedra 6](./images/tetra_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The edges are numbered in yellow, and the vertices numbered in green.  Of special note is edge 18 which spans opposite corners of the cell.  This edge is shared by all tetrahedra in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the eye point is placed at the lower corner and looking at the upper corner of the main diagonal, you'll see the silhouettes of the 6 tetrahedra arranged around the main diagonal (edge 18), and indexed in counter-clockwise order (see lookup table).  Use this intuition to guide your understanding of the cell's (and tetrahedra's) role within the algorithm.  Consult the lookup tables to see how the tetrahedra are defined relative to this view.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Marching Tetrahedra 6](./images/tetra_6_view.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cell class should include the following properties:\n",
    "- __Count__: Active count of number of vertices in the cell with pole values\n",
    "- __values__: list/array of pole values.\n",
    "- __positions__: list/array of pole positions.\n",
    "- __edgeMap__: list where each index represents an edge of the cell. An index's value is the vertex index inserted by the Marching algorithm, or -1 if no vertex stored on that edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cell class should include the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __\\_\\_init\\_\\_()__: initializes the cell's properties\n",
    "- __addPole( pole )__: Inserts a pole at the next available corner of the cell.\n",
    "- __copyEdgeMap( cellU, cellV, cellW )__: copies vertex indices from adjacent cell(s) edges to the current cell's edges where the edges are common to both cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the copyEdgeMap() method, the arguments cellU, cellV, and cellW are the adjacent cells bordering the left, front, and bottom sides respectively of the current cell.  Depending on the location within the scalar field, these adjacent cells may not be available.  copyEdgeMap() must recognize these situations and react accordingly.  A better intuition may be developed how to implement this feature when implementing the IsoMesh class in the next section."

    "Marching Tetrahedra 5 is a variant of the Marching Tetrahedra algorithm which subdivides the cell into 5 tetrahedra instead of 6.  This algorithm is more efficient as fewer triangles are generated, and less computation occurs.  However, to get those benefits requires a few trade offs which make the algorithm a bit more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you subdivde the cell into 5 tetrahedra by drawing diagonals along each edge in an alternating pattern as you walk around the cell, you'll notice two tetrahedra can be formed at the bottom of the cell at opposite corners, and two more tetrahedra can be formed at the top of the cell also at opposite corners, but perpendicular to the bottom two tetrahedra.  This conveniently leaves a void in the middle of the cell which happens to be the 5th tetrahedron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is the diagonals of the cell do not align with the diagonals of the adjacent cells.  Fortunately, inspection reveals rotating the cell by 90 degrees on the vertical axis will resolve the problem.  This means we must rotate every other cell in the scalar field by 90 degrees to form a cohesive isosurface, which can be a bit of a headache to manage.  The cell's vertices and edges will be numbered the same as in Marching Tetrahedra 6, but the 19th edge (e18) no longer exists, and some of the diagonals will have an alternate orientation forming a zig-zag as you walk around the cell (numbering is not affected by change in orientation)."

    "\n",
    "1. The Marching Cubes algorithm produces triangles in the resulting polygon mesh. If we could merge triangles to form quadrilateral polygons in cases where the triangles are expected to be coplanar, the vertex and polygon counts could be significantly reduced saving valuable computational resources and lead to a much more pleasing result.  How much reduction can be achieved?  How would you implement this feature?  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our algorithm works in a classic single-threaded model.  Could we accelerate the algorithm using parallel computing?  Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",

    "4. The Marching Tetrahedra algorithms avoid ambiguity, but introduce an excessive number of triangles that do not necessarily improve the shape of the resulting isosurface.  Why do the extra triangles not improve the isosurface?  How can this be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inspection reveals most of the time is spent copying values onto cell vertices whether it be from the scalar field or from adjacent cells.  How would you modify the algorithm to be more efficient in this regard?\n",
