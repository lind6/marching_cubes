Face descriptions for simple cases can be determined fairly quickly, but as the number of positive vertices in the configuration increases, so does the complexity.  This is where it may be more practical to consider an algorithmic approach as doing it manually leads to silly errors, not to mention tedium.\n",

You will develop functions for each of the 22 unique cube configurations and generate the appropriate face descriptions accounting for symmetry and rotations.  The output will be a table of 256 entries and be suitable for use with the project , 'Visualizing Superquadrics with Marching Cubes and Marching Tetrahedra'.\n",

The edges will be numbered similarly, but with the vertical edges defined last, also counterclockwise around the vertical axis.
