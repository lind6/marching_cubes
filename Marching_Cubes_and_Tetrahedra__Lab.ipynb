    "In this lab, you will implement the Marching Cubes and Marching Tetrahedra algorithms to generate isosurfaces from volumetric data.  The superquadric primitives will be employed as the volumetric data to be visualized to illustrate the differences.  Before proceeding, read chapter 2 \"Marching Cubes and Variants\" from the book __Isosurfaces: Geometry, Toplogy, and Algorithms__ by Rephael Wenger (CRC Press / AK Peters Publishing).  The book can be downloaded for free as a .pdf from the CRC Press website when accessed through the UIUC library.\n",

    "__Marching Cubes__ is an algorithm for generating isosurfaces from volumetric data by subdividing a volume into virtual cubes and marching through the volume evaluating each cube in turn.  The results of each cube are stitched together to form a contiguous polygon mesh as the isosurface.  Marching Cubes can be easily implemented with the use of a lookup table and performs in linear time making it a practical choice for generating isosurfaces.  However the algorithm has a few weaknesses.  One weakness is data in some cubes may be ambiguous leading to uncertainty as to how the isosurface should be constructed.  Either additional computation, or conscious biased choices in the lookup table must be made to resolve ambiguities and produce a cohesive isosurface.  Reference: [Marching Cubes (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Marching Tetrahedra__ is a variation employed by many who couldn't use Marching Cubes due to patent restrictions.  Marching Tetrahedra can be viewed as an extension of Marching Cubes as it follows the same principle but dissects the cubes into tetrahedra producing more granularity which resolves all ambiguity and produces a correct isosurface every time.  However, this comes at the expense of additional computation and significantly more triangles and vertices in the resulting isosurface.  Within the Marching tetrahedra algorithm are variants decomposing the cube into 5 tetrahedra or 6 tetrahedra.  Each has their strengths and weaknesses as we'll see later.  Reference: [Marching Tetrahedra (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_tetrahedra).\n",

    "__Superquadrics__ are a class of primitives defined by variations of the sphere equation.  In addition to scientific visualization, superquadrics have been employed in computer graphics under the name of 'metaballs' or 'blobby particles' for density based modeling techniques favorable to haptic sculpting and simulating modeling with clay.  Metaballs are usually enhanced with features such as attractive and repulsive blending enabling metaballs to act as carving and shaping tools in the modeling process, and to represent liquids and other formless shapes.  When the number of metaballs becomes large, representation moves to point clouds employing blobby particles.   One example of superquadrics used as metaballs in commercial filmmaking is the main animated character in the 1997 movie [Flubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubber_(film)).  Commerical software applications using this technique include [Z-Brush (PixelLogic)](https://pixologic.com/) and [MudBox (AutoDesk)](https://www.autodesk.com/products/mudbox/overview).

    "# Part 1: Generate a polygon mesh from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the isosurface is represented as a polygon mesh because it can represent almost any surface due to it's arbitrary nature, and most algorithms can be employed without sophisticated mathematics.  However, polygon meshes are approximations of the surface they represent as all vertices are connected by linear edges. For example, it would require near infinite resolution to represent a highly curved surface as the linear edges would require many vertices to be placed close together to approximate the curvature making for an impractical choice.  The result is always a compromise between the desired output and available computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygon meshes can be created in PyVista using the pyvista.PolyData() class.  PolyData requires two lists:\n",
    "1. Vertex Positions\n",
    "2. Polygon connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex positions are provided as XYZ position vectors described in the coordinate space of the object.  Each position vector is a 1D array of scalars of size 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polygon connectivity is provided as a list of face descriptions.  Each face description a 1D array of __N+1__ entries, where __N__ represents the number of sides in the polygon and is the first value in the face description.  The trailing values are the indices of the vertices in the vertex positions list which form the polygon and specified in the order that respects the _right hand rule_.  The last specified index will automatically be connected by an edge to the first specified index to complete the polygon.  Face descriptions must be provided as row vectors, hence the use of np.hstack() below to format the list.  Keep that in mind if using something other than numpy to form your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Right hand rule__:  Using the fingers of your right hand like a loose fist to flow (point) in the ordered direction the vertices are connected, your extended thumb will point in the direction of the surface normal.  The surface normal will always be perpendicular to the plane of the polygon and point in the direction considered the 'front' side of the polygon.  If viewing the polygon's front side, the vertices will be connected in a counter-clockwise direction.  If the order is incorrect, the polygon will be inverted or corrupt.  Exact details of how this situation is handled varies by API.\n",

    "In the code block below, construct two polygon mesh cubes, each from a vertex positions list and polygon connectivity list.  For the first polygon mesh, desribe the faces as triangles.  In the second polygon mesh, describe each face as a quadrilateral polygon.  Place the first vertex at (0,0,0), the remaining vertices along the positive X, Y, and Z axes, and constrained to range [0...1].  For this exercise, assume the X and Y axes span the ground plane, and the Z axis is the vertical axis."

After all edges have been tested, each tetrahedron in the cell is evaluated to construct polygon(s) by 'connecting the dots' using the appropriate inserted vertices.  In this section you'll implement `evalTetra()` to construct the polygon(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The evalTetra() function has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __tetraIndex__: (int) Index of the tetrahedron being evaluated within the cell, in range [0...5].\n",
    "- __bitCode__: (int) Each bit of the code represents one of the 8 vertices of the cell.  If a bit is nonzero, the corresponding vertex is marked as a positive pole.  For example, a bitcode of `00100101` means vertices 0, 2, and 5 are marked as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow is as follows:\n",
    "- Use the tetraIndex parameter to get the tetrahedron's vertices from the lookup table.\n",
    "- Read the bit code to determine which of the tetrahedron's vertices are positive poles.\n",
    "- Determine which edges of the tetrahedron intersect the isosurface.  An intersection occurs where the bits of adjacent vertices do not match.\n",
    "- Construct a polygon description for the newly generated triangle(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each triangle is a list of 4 integers where the first value is always '3' to indicate a 3-sided polygon, and the last 3 values are the edge indices of the tetrahedron containing the inserted vertices of the formed triangle specified in the order that respects the right hand rule (i.e. the surface normals of the generated triangles should point towards the positive poles).  \n",

However, to get those benefits requires a compromises which make the algorithm a bit more complicated.\n",

This conveniently leaves a void in the middle of the cell which happens to be the 5th tetrahedron.\n",

Fortunately, inspection reveals rotating the adjacent cells by 90 degrees on the vertical axis will resolve the problem.

The cell's vertices and edges will be numbered the same as in Marching Tetrahedra 6, but the 19th edge (edge 18) no longer exists, and some of the diagonals will have an alternate orientation (numbering is not affected by change in orientation)."

    "Now it's time to play.  Define the superquadric parameters, create the scalar field, then generate the isosurface using the 3 Marching algorithms we implemented.  Store each polygon mesh separately so we may display and compare them in a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default scalar field should span from [-5,-5,-5] to [5,5,5] with cell size of 0.25 units, but you are free to define any size you like.  Keep in mind execution time is proportional to the number of cells in the scalar field.  So pay attention to the cell size in relation to the scalar field dimensions.  If you're not careful, you can easily exceed system memory leading to extreme performance degradation or crash.\n",

    "Congratulations, you have completed the lab!  Be proud of your accomplishment, but be aware you have only completed a basic implementation of the Marching algorithms.  Adequate as a learning exercise, but not ideal for practice.  Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Marching Cubes algorithm produces triangles in the resulting polygon mesh. If we could merge triangles to form quadrilateral polygons in cases where the triangles are expected to be coplanar, the vertex and polygon counts could be significantly reduced saving valuable computational resources and lead to a much more pleasing result.  How much reduction can be achieved?  How would you implement this feature?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The cells are accumulated as the scalar field is traversed, but we never backtrack more than an adjacent cell neighbor.  This means we store cells much longer than necessary leading to excessive memory consumption, and potentially slowing execution.  How would you fix that?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our algorithm works in a classic single-threaded model.  Could we accelerate the algorithm using parallel computing?  Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Marching Tetrahedra algorithms avoid ambiguity, but introduce an excessive number of triangles that do not necessarily improve the shape of the resulting isosurface.  Why do the extra triangles not improve the isosurface?  How can this be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inspection reveals most of the time is spent copying values onto cell vertices whether it be from the scalar field or from adjacent cells.  How would you modify the algorithm to be more efficient in this regard?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What other improvements can you think of?"
